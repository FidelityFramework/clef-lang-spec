## 1. Overview

Delimited continuations are the substrate under `async { }`, actor `receive`, and every synchronous suspension point. This chapter specifies them as **graph structure**: a computation-expression region is elaborated by the suspension recipe (§2) into segments and a frame, its delimiter is the boundary of the subgraph the builder's extent defines, and the whole is settled at saturation before any code exists. What the witness emits is standard dialects only — a discriminant, a byte frame with static views, function values, and `scf.index_switch` (§5). There is no continuation operation surface, and no continuation dialect, above the witness boundary ([Backend Lowering Architecture §2.1](backend-lowering-architecture.md)).

This position supersedes an earlier framing of this chapter in which a target-neutral operation surface (`cont.new` / `cont.suspend` / `cont.resume`) was the normative object and each target supplied a lowering pass over it. That framing followed the dialect-level encoding of the WAMI work (§References). It is retired for the reason the [Program Hypergraph](program-hypergraph.md) states generally: the semantics ride in the graph, the judgments discharge over its literals, and what reaches MLIR is the settled decomposition. A `cont`-style vocabulary may still exist **below** the boundary as transliteration for a target that natively hosts continuations (§5.2); the front end does not emit it.

The delimited continuation is one instance of the general environment object of [Closure Representation](closure-representation.md): the closure environment, the continuation frame, and the actor state cell are three instances of one node, placed by one fold-in rule. Everything the flat-closure chapter establishes — the finiteness lemma, the enumerated capture set, deterministic layout, the lifetime lattice — is inherited here, and the frame's obligations quantify over enumerated structure for the same reason a closure's do ([Closure Representation §11](closure-representation.md)).

## 2. The Suspension Recipe

Elaboration carries the continuation as a recipe in the sense of the [Program Semantic Graph](program-semantic-graph.md) saturation discipline: fan-out elaborates the region into structure; fold-in settles what that structure literally is.

**Fan-out: segments at cuts.** A computation-expression region is split at its suspension points. Each `let!` / `do!` (and each construct that lowers to one: an actor `receive`, the reply wait of a [synchronous RPC](synchronous-rpc-liveness.md)) is a **cut**. The code between two cuts is a **segment**; the code from the last cut to the builder's return is the final segment. The **delimiter** is structure: the boundary of the subgraph the builder's extent defines. No operation carries it, so the ill-formed shapes an operation encoding admits cannot arise — there is no op result for a continuation to self-reference, and no region boundary for a live value to cross. Reset is where the region ends, by construction.

**Per-segment liveness.** For each cut, the **live-across set** is the set of bindings live on the path from that suspension point to the region's end. These become frame slots. The frame is not a new object: it is the environment node of [Closure Representation](closure-representation.md), carrying the state-machine slot class fixed in [Closure Representation §7](closure-representation.md) — captures read-only across resumptions, internal state read-modify-write between cuts, the in-flight value and the discriminant written at each cut.

**Resumption sources are an edge class.** The frame's awaited delivery is one edge with four members today: I/O completion, mailbox delivery, interrupt, DMA completion. The constructs of §1 differ only in that edge. One recipe serves all of them.

**Fold-in settles three things, all literal at saturation.**

| Settled | Rule |
|---|---|
| **State count** | the number of cuts, literally: a region with *N* cuts folds to a discriminant over *N*+2 values — not-started, one per cut, done |
| **Frame layout** | slot assignment by interference colouring over segment liveness: two live-across values whose lifetimes do not overlap share a slot; the result is a byte frame with literal extent and literal offsets |
| **Placement** | by the lifetime lattice of [Closure Representation §3.3](closure-representation.md): a continuation that does not escape its delimiter lives on the stack; one that does (a mailbox holding suspended receives, a stored future) lives in a region whose lifetime covers it; the escape class is read at fold-in, the same read the closure forms make |

**Nested delimiters resolve statically.** In the saturated graph every suspension point carries an edge to its delimiter by construction: fan-out created the cut inside exactly one builder extent, and the edge records that extent. An inner `async` inside an actor `receive` yields two extents, and each cut belongs to the extent that cut it. The compiled program contains no prompt tag and performs no dynamic search for a matching reset, on any target.

## 3. Relationship to Sequence Expressions and Closures

The continuation frame joins the family of resumable-computation representations, each an instance of the environment node of [Closure Representation §7](closure-representation.md):

| Form | Suspends to | Captured state | Resumed by |
|------|-------------|----------------|------------|
| `seq { }` ([seq](seq-representation.md)) | yield a value outward | loop-local internal state | the caller's pull |
| **delimited continuation** (this chapter) | await a value inward | the delimited remainder | delivery on the resumption edge |
| `Observable` / `Incremental` | (opaque, push-driven) | subscriber closure | emission / staleness |

`seq { }` is the **degenerate case** of this recipe: every resumption source is the caller's pull, and `yield` is the cut. Its form — the pair `(moveNext, {state, current, captures, internal_state})` — is a compiled one-shot delimited continuation: `state` is the discriminant, `current` the in-flight value, the captures and internal state the live-across slots, and `MoveNext` is resume with a narrowed signature. The suspension recipe generalizes the resumption edge and keeps the representation ([Sequence Expression Representation §5](seq-representation.md)).

## 4. Suspended-Continuation State

Independent of any target, a suspended continuation carries the state the recipe of §2 implies. A conforming implementation SHALL realize this state as the frame; §5 gives its witnessed form.

- **Suspension index** — the discriminant: which cut the continuation paused at (`0` = not yet started; `1..N` = paused at the *N*th cut; done = ran to its origin).
- **In-flight value** — the value delivered on the resumption edge (read inward) or passed outward at the cut.
- **Live-across set** — the bindings live on the path from a cut to the continuation's origin, per cut. This is the delimited remainder; it is what distinguishes a continuation from a `seq`, whose captured state is loop-local.
- **Internal state** — `let mutable` bindings threaded across cuts.

The live-across computation is the one analysis this chapter adds over `seq`. It is computed per cut at elaboration and consumed, never recomputed, at fold-in and at the witness.

## 5. The Witnessed Form and the Target Legs

What crosses the witness boundary is standard dialects only: a discriminant, a byte frame with static `memref.view`s at literal offsets, function values, and `scf.index_switch` over the discriminant. No continuation dialect, no `llvm` dialect, no new op. The correspondence table of [Closure Representation §6.3](closure-representation.md) covers every constituent; the suspension form adds the discriminant switch and nothing else.

```mlir
// resume: load the discriminant, dispatch to the segment, run to the next cut
func.func private @region_resume(%frame: memref<Exi8>, %delivered: T) -> i1 {
  %c0 = arith.constant 0 : index
  %sv = memref.view %frame[%c0][] : memref<Exi8> to memref<1xindex>
  %s  = memref.load %sv[%c0] : memref<1xindex>
  %again = scf.index_switch %s -> i1
    case 0 { ... segment 0 ... store in-flight, store 1, scf.yield %true }
    case 1 { ... segment 1 ... }
    default { ... store done, scf.yield %false }
  return %again : i1
}
```

`E`, every slot offset, and every discriminant literal are fixed at saturation (§2). The frame is the same 1-D `i8` buffer with identity layout that `memref.view` requires as its source, which is why the standard dialect already contains the elaborated form.

Below the boundary, each target leg realizes the same saturated structure in its own shape. The realizations are stated with the profile conditions that select them; none changes what the witness emits.

### 5.1 CPU and MCU: the state-machine form

The witnessed form runs as written: `scf.index_switch` dispatches on the discriminant, each case is a segment, and resume is a call that loads the frame, switches, and runs to the next cut. On a freestanding target the frame is stack- or region-placed with no heap involvement (§2, placement), and resume has the `MoveNext` shape of [seq §5.1](seq-representation.md):

```
resume: (memref<Exi8>, T) -> i1   // true if it suspended again, false at the origin
```

This is the first realization to build, and it is the `seq` state machine generalized.

### 5.2 Stack switching

A target that exposes suspend/resume as a first-class primitive (the WebAssembly stack-switching proposal, when its runtime support matures) may receive the saturated frame and discriminant transliterated into that primitive by a **backend leg**, below the boundary, in the target's own vocabulary. That vocabulary expresses the target upward ([Backend Lowering Architecture §3.2](backend-lowering-architecture.md)); it never expresses Clef downward, and the front end never emits it. The witnessed form of §5 is unchanged; only the leg differs.

### 5.3 Host coroutines (JSIR pathway)

> This subsection binds implementations claiming the **JavaScript Substrate** profile ([Conformance §7](conformance.md)).

On the JSIR pathway the host's suspendable functions are the suspend/resume primitive: each cut is realized by the host's async-function or generator mechanism, and the §4 state is carried by the host coroutine's own frame under the carrier-realization rule of [Backend Lowering Architecture §4.5](backend-lowering-architecture.md). Resume is delivery by the host event loop; the run-to-completion guarantee between cuts is supplied by the single-threaded host and is the substrate-discharged form of the discipline in §7 (see the isolate row of [Scheduler Contract §7](scheduler-contract.md)). A rejection delivered at a cut that a boundary operation awaited is intercepted per [JavaScript Boundary Semantics §6](javascript-boundary.md). The structure of §2 and the state of §4 are unchanged; only the realization differs.

## 6. PSG Structure and Verification Conditions

A continuation region saturates to a frame node — the environment node of [Closure Representation](closure-representation.md) in its second instance — with these constituents settled:

```
Frame (environment node, state-machine slot class) {
    Delimiter:        edge to the builder extent that owns this region
    Cuts:             (NodeId * int) list      // each suspension point and its discriminant value
    LiveAcross:       per cut, the enumerated slot set
    InternalState:    NodeId list              // let mutable across cuts
    Segments:         NodeId list              // per-cut resume code
    ResumptionEdge:   the edge class member (I/O, mailbox, interrupt, DMA)
}
```

The frame is minted by the suspension recipe at saturation, in the front end. Its discriminant values, slot offsets, and extent are literals on the graph, projected onto the nodes they govern as annotations the witness reads ([Program Hypergraph §5](program-hypergraph.md)). No code generator assigns them, and no analysis beside the graph recomputes them.

Every obligation the suspension form generates is quantifier-free, in the discharge regime of [Closure Representation §11](closure-representation.md): at saturation, over the graph's literals, before witnessing. For a frame with slots *s*₀..*s*ₙ₋₁, offsets *off*ᵢ, sizes *size*ᵢ, extent *E*, and cut count *N*:

| VC | Obligation | Fragment | Discharge |
|---|---|---|---|
| VC-EXT | *size*₀ + … + *size*ₙ₋₁ + pad = *E* | QF_LIA | ground arithmetic over literals |
| VC-STATE | every store to the discriminant writes a literal in [−1, *N*] | QF_LIA | finite conjunction over literals |
| VC-ACC | for each state *k*, the slots read by segment *k* are within live(*k*) | none; sets | per-state check against segment liveness, enumerated |
| VC-DOM | the delimiter node dominates every cut it encloses | none; graph | dominance check on the saturated graph |
| VC-ONE | each suspended frame is resumed exactly once | none; linear | linear obligation on the frame value |

Because VC-ONE is stated on the frame value, multi-shot is well-defined where it is declared: a frame copy is a byte copy of *E* bytes, legitimate because the frame is flat with literal extent, and each copy carries its own VC-ONE. Multi-shot is never the silent default.

## 7. NORMATIVE: Single-Core Cooperative Scheduling

Delimited continuations are pervasive in Clef and carry no scheduling role of their own; the frame and its resume are what `async`, actor `receive`, and every suspension point saturate to, on every target. On a **single-core** small-form-factor target ([Backend Lowering Architecture](backend-lowering-architecture.md) §5 defines the freestanding pathway), one further fact holds: the suspend/resume semantics **become** the cooperative scheduler. This is a forcing function of the braid, not a property of continuations. With one thread of control and no room for a separate scheduler runtime, a continuation that suspends is the only thing that can hand the core to another, so the braid presses the continuation's own suspend/resume into the scheduler's role — no task queue or preemption mechanism is introduced because none can be. The operative constraint is the single core, not the freestanding host: a freestanding pathway is not inherently single-core, and where the target has more cores the braid coordinates them by other means, out of this section's scope. This section states the single-core discipline normatively so it can be relied upon; it holds regardless of which §5 leg realizes the frame.

A conforming single-core implementation SHALL observe:

1. **Continuations are tasks.** A suspended frame is a runnable unit. There is no task object distinct from the frame itself.

2. **Resume is the scheduling event.** A continuation runs only when resumed by delivery on its resumption edge. On a bare-metal freestanding target the delivery source is a peripheral interrupt (or a completion the interrupt records); the interrupt-to-continuation binding is the scheduler's dispatch.

3. **Run-to-completion until the next cut (non-preemption).** Once resumed, a continuation runs its segment until it reaches its next cut or its origin. It is never preempted mid-segment. This is the cooperative guarantee: a continuation yields the core only at a cut, never involuntarily.

4. **Quiescence to low power.** When no continuation is runnable — every frame is suspended awaiting delivery — the implementation SHALL return the core to a wait state (e.g. `WFI` on Arm) until the next interrupt. The interrupt resumes the awaiting continuation, and the cycle repeats.

The interrupt handler that delivers a value SHALL be a captureless top-level handler bound directly to the vector-table slot (hardware vectors carry no environment pointer); it reaches the frame through the resume entry point, not through a captured closure. The progress guarantee under this discipline is that every continuation whose awaited value has been delivered is eventually resumed; on a single core with one interrupt source per suspension class this reduces to "the handler resumes the awaiting continuation," and no fairness policy beyond interrupt priority is required.

> This is the sense in which the concurrency model reduces to an event loop *on a single core*:
> the braided crossing (a cut that spawns an awaited computation and threads its result back
> through the remainder) is held by the frame, and where the target has one core the frame's
> own suspend/resume is the whole of the scheduling. The reduction is a property of the core
> count, not of the freestanding host — the same continuation semantics carry to a multi-core
> target, where the scheduling is more than one event loop.

## 8. SSA Cost

On the §5.1 leg the resume state machine has the `seq` SSA cost profile ([seq §5](seq-representation.md)): one discriminant load and switch at entry, plus per cut the in-flight store and discriminant store, plus the live-across loads on each resume. No allocation-site cost is added for a scope-bounded frame (stack/region), matching the zero-heap requirement of a freestanding target.

## 9. Normative Requirements

1. **Graph structure, not an operation surface.** A delimited continuation SHALL be expressed on the Program Semantic Graph by the suspension recipe of §2 — segments at cuts, a frame, and a delimiter edge from every cut to the builder extent that owns it. An implementation SHALL NOT express continuations as a continuation operation surface or continuation dialect above the witness boundary.
2. **Suspended state.** The frame SHALL realize the state of §4: the discriminant, the in-flight value, the live-across set per cut, and internal state.
3. **Live-across set.** The live-across set of a cut SHALL be the bindings live on the path from that cut to the continuation's origin — the delimited remainder — computed at elaboration and consumed, not recomputed, thereafter.
4. **Witnessed form.** The witness SHALL emit the form of §5: a discriminant, a byte frame of literal extent with static `memref.view`s at literal offsets, function values, and `scf.index_switch` over the discriminant, in the portable dialects of [Backend Lowering Architecture §2.1](backend-lowering-architecture.md) and no other.
5. **Target legs below the boundary.** A target that natively hosts continuations MAY transliterate the witnessed frame and discriminant into its own primitive in a backend leg (§5.2). Such a leg SHALL consume the witnessed form; it SHALL NOT be a change to what the witness emits.
6. **Verification conditions.** The obligations of §6 SHALL be discharged at saturation, over the graph's literals, before witnessing; VC-ONE SHALL be stated on the frame value.
7. **Cooperative discipline.** A single-core implementation SHALL observe the scheduling discipline of §7 (continuations-as-tasks, resume-as-dispatch, run-to-completion, quiescence-to-wait).
